#Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.

largest = None
smallest = None

while True:
    try:
        num = input("Enter a number: ")    
        if num == "done": break
        if len(num) < 1: break 
        new = int(num)
        if largest is None or largest < new:
            largest = new
            #print (largest)
        elif smallest is None or smallest > new:
                smallest = new
            #print (smallest)
    except:
        print ("Invalid input")
        #continue
