#Exercise 3:
#Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.

#word = 'banana'
word = input("Enter a word: ")
def count(word, desired):
    count = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter == desired:
            count = count + 1
    print(count)
    
count(word, "a")
