#Exercise 1: 
#Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the string and works its way backwards to the first character in the string, printing each letter on a separate line, except backwards.


fruit = input("Enter word: ")
index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
    try:
        letter = fruit[index - 1]
        print(letter)
        index = index - 1
    except:
        break
