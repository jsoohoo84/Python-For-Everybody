#Exercise 6:

#Read the documentation of the string methods at

#https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

#You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.

#The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. 
#So sub is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is optional.

data = 'banana'
print(data)
print(data.capitalize())

line = '  what does the fox say  '
print(line)
print(line.strip())
 
print(line)

print(line.replace('say', 'make'))
