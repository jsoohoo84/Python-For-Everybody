#Exercise 7.2
#Write a program to prompt for a file name, and then read through the file and look for lines of the form:

#X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475

#When you encounter a line that starts with "X-DSPAM-Confidence:" pull apart the line to extract the floating-point number on the line.
#Count these lines and then compute the total of the spam confidence values from these lines.
#When you reach the end of the file, print out the average spam confidence.

#Enter the file name: mbox.txt
#Average spam confidence: 0.894128046745

#Enter the file name: mbox-short.txt
#Average spam confidence: 0.750718518519
#Test your file on the mbox.txt and mbox-short.txt files.
