# Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters "done". 
# Once "done" is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. 
# If the user enters anything other than a number, 
# detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.
#Enter a number: 4
#Enter a number: 5
#Enter a number: bad data
#Invalid input
#Enter a number: 7
#Enter a number: done
#16 3 5.333333333333333
